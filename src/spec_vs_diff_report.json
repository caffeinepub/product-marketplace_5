      "reason": "The migration.mo logic checks for and adds 'shape type' under '3d print', but there's no evidence in the diff that a '3d print' parent category exists or is created. The createDefaultCategoriesAndPriceConstraints() method only creates 'Ceramic Ocarina' and '3D Printed Ocarina' categories, with no '3d print' parent visible.",
